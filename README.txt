Hello, dear betatester.

To begin to play, just open the .exe within this directory. This test has background music (that can be stopped inside the application).

Sadly, the source webside has added scraping protection: executing the code itself from an IDE Will not work, but the .exe is still working.

The music in this program is property of its authors (Yoko Shimomura & Square Enix, from Final Fantasy XV).
